# Arduino
This repo consists of various Arduino projects code and proteus network models which is used for simulations. 

These repo includes projects such as: \
- Displaying informations on 4-bit, 8-bit & 16x2 LCD display
- Usage of various motors and sensors 
- Measure of Light Intensity with LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) sensor
- Detection of sound intensity using Sound Detector Sensor
- Measure of temperature using Thermocouple sensor
- Transmission Line Fault Identification

```.pdsprj ``` extension is for proteus simulation files \
```.pdsbak``` extension is for arduino code files
